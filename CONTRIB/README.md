## Guidelines

Please review the following [Coding guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to ensure your coding style matches that of the project. We also recommend you review the [Pull Request Guidelines & Instructions](PULL_REQUEST_GUIDE_INSTRUCT.md) before making a Pull Request. Once you have read the above and are ready to get started, go claim an issue and start coding!!

## Good Practice

_Your code should tell the story of what you are doing; your comments should tell the story of why you are doing it._
(Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/142869)

- Use the following prefixes when commenting:
  - `// TODO` if there is still a meaningful task to be done
  - `// FIXME` if there is something that needs to be fixed before merging
  - `// HACK` if you know or believe there is a better implementation

- Function should be precisely defined (Example: a function that is undefined for negative integers should raise an error when a negative integer is given as input)
